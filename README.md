# Baseball3
 
Hi. Welcome to Baseball3. In this version, there are different kind of pitches, and balls in play are modeled much more precisely. Additionally, Aidan starts to learn that DataFrames might be helpful.

Baseball3.py - main file, startup

DirectoryWide.py - Collection of variables and functions that I wanted the freedom to call from anywhere without worrying about circular import statements.

The rest I think do be what they do be.
